## PhotoBox fixture

The program helps users control the capture images and removes the guesswork of the camera settings for specific food loads used. It was designed to keep the camera settings and the file naming metrics consistent across multiple fixtures. It also removes the tedious process of sharing the images with multiple users by sending the image to the user's email address once the image is captured. This was implemented to aid personel with minimum technical knowledge about programming or camera operations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
$sudo apt-get install --reinstall pcmanfm
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
